        <h1>Kaitlyn Kushner's Biography</h1>
        <p>My name is Kaitlyn Kushner and I am <strong>a passionate audio-visual storyteller</strong> based in the New York and Cincinnati areas.</p>
        <p>I am a fourth-year student at Syracuse University in New York studying Television, Radio, and Film at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. Additionally, I have minors in Psychology and Information and Technology Management. I am excited to use these scholastic skills alongside my life skills to create a more understanding and informed world through narrative film. My recent accomplishments include working as a Development and Packaging Intern for a creative production company, Braintrust, in London, working as a primary Videographer for the Dynamic Sustainability Lab (DSL) at Syracuse University, and as the Director of Communications for Circle Tail, an Ohio-based Cincinnati non-profit.</p>
