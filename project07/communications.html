        <p>I have held a variety of positions in the Communications field, such as Director Communications at the Ohio-based non-profit, Circle Tail, and the North Carolina-based summer camp, Durham Academy Summer. As the primary point of contact for community members, I ensured seamless direction and project delivery from concept to completion. Additionally, I collaborated with a broad network of internal teams to develop and execute innovative campaigns to widen local and global reach for my clients, all while staying within budgets and timelines. I invite you to preview some of my work below.</p>
