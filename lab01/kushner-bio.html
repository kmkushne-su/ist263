    </head>

    <body>
        My name is Kaitlyn Kushner and I am a passionate audio-visual storyteller based in the New York and Cincinnati areas. I am a fourth-year student at Syracuse University in New York studying Television, Radio, and Film at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. Additionally, I have minors in Psychology and Information and Technology Management. I am excited to use these scholastic skills alongside my life skills to create a more understanding and informed world through narrative film. My recent accomplishments include working as a Development and Packaging Intern for a creative production company, Braintrust, in London, working as a primary Videographer for the Dynamic Sustainability Lab (DSL) at Syracuse University, and as the Director of Communications for Circle Tail, an Ohio-based Cincinnati non-profit. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, listening to music, exploring, and (most importantly) spending time with loved ones. I love to meet new people and stay connected!
